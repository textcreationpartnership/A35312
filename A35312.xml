            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Here preſent to You a Prince, whoſe Memory, as well by reaſon of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualifications, as of the Honour he had to be Allied to
<pb facs="tcp:56651:3"/>You by the ſtrict Tyes of Blood (being the Only Brother to Your Royal Spouſe) cannot but be very ſacred to You.

It is this, that has enboldned me to lay the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe at Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes feet; which without this Plea, I ſhould look upon as an impardonable Preſumption.
<pb facs="tcp:56651:3"/>And upon this Occaſion, I know, I ſhould enter upon the Theme of Your Royal Vertues; but as the Illuſtrious Rank You bear in theſe Kingdoms has rendred them ſo Conſpicuous to the eyes of All the World, as to be beyond the due Praiſes of a private Hand, ſo I will rather deviate from the common Road of our Modern Dedicators, than fall under the Cenſure of have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undertaken a Task, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelf unable to perform.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Thought I could not pitch upon a more ſeaſonable Juncture to expoſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Memoirs to Publick View, than this, when the Differences betwixt the two Houſes of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> (which make up a conſiderable part of them) are likely to kindle a War in the North. I was alſo perſwaded, that I could not eaſily hit upon a more favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, than this to vindicate in ſome meaſure, the Memory of a Brave and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Prince, from the Aſperſions caſt upon him ſome Years ago by a certain Perſon, who, as he is generally ſuppoſed to have had but a very ſlender inſight into the Affairs of the North,<note place="margin">The Author of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, 1692.</hi>
               </note> by reaſon of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unacquainted with the Language and true State of thoſe Countries, ſo had by his own Confeſſion, taken many things, he tells us with ſo much Aſſurance, upon the Credit of others; Beſides, that the ill Conduct he is charged with by the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Court, which drew upon him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb facs="tcp:56651:6"/>of that Prince, whoſe Life and Reign we have given you an Account of in the following Sheets, may give us ſome Reaſon to ſuſpect, that Revenge and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice might have a conſiderable Share in thoſe Suggeſtions, ſome of which, to ſpeak the Truth, contain more Bitterneſs than is conſiſtent with the true Genius of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd Hiſtorian. It was not my Province at this time to enter upon an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of the Particulars of that Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney contained in the ſaid Treatiſe; my Opinion being, that by giving a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Chief Tranſactions of the Life and Reign of this Prince, together with what attended them, and that from authentick and unqueſtionable Authority, I ſhould be able to put things in a true light, leaving the reſt to the Judgment of the impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>As I have not the leaſt Engagement to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Crown, either by Birth, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or upon any other account, ſo I have taken all imaginable Care, to repreſent Matters without Paſſion or prepoſſeſſion, as will be eaſily diſcernable by all ſuch, as will take the pains to compare the Reaſons alledg'd and inſerted here, on both ſides, founded altogether upon authentick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Abſtracts of the Records of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:56651:6"/>Countries. To repreſent to the Reader the whole Matter in Conteſt betwixt thoſe two Houſes, in as full a View as the Bulk of this Treatiſe would admit of; I thought it abſolutely requiſite to trace the very Original of thoſe Differences, which make ſo much Noiſe in the World at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as in the Introduction, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew the ſteps that were made towards that Revolution, which was the Conſequence of that War, which reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> to the very brink of deſtruction, the Effects of which, it is ſenſible of to this day.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, there are three different Inſtances in this Treatiſe of the Miſchiefs which always are the unavoidable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of inteſtine Diviſions.</p>
            <p>The Nobility of <hi>Denmark</hi> made it their Buſineſs for ſeveral Ages together to Aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize their own Power, by ſuppreſſing both the Royal Prerogatives, and the Liberties of the other Eſtates; all the fruits they reap'd by it, were to involve the Kingdom into ſuch Troubles, as had almoſt prov'd fatal to it, and ended in the Total Ruine of their ſo much admired Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Commonalty of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> not contented with a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Share (allotted them by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb facs="tcp:56651:7"/>Conſtitution of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) in the Management of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were for clipping the Senates Authority, to Aggrandize their own, the Conſequences of which were, that finding themſelves entangl'd in unſurmountable Difficulties, they furniſh'd a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, for the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King to renew his old Pretenſions (which, to confeſs the Truth, are none of the worſt) and to back them with Fire and Sword; The iſſue of it was, that the Miſchief fell upon the heads of thoſe, who had been the Chief occaſion of it; tho' at the ſame time the remainders of thoſe Diſſentions are not rooted out to this day, and conſequently the ſame Danger attends them. So certain it is, that whenever the Foundation-ſtone, upon which the Frame of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is built, is either removed or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Structure muſt of neceſſity fall, be it ſoon or late.</p>
            <p>I need not enlarge my ſelf much upon the Third, which are the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> the Effects of it have made too much Noiſe in our Age, as not to be remembred; What advantage did <hi>Frederick</hi> the preſent Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi>'s Grandfather get, by firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Foundation-ſtone of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb facs="tcp:56651:7"/>Unions betwixt thoſe two Families, in ſiding with <hi>Sweden</hi> againſt <hi>Denmark?</hi> Beſides the devaſtations of his Territories during that War with <hi>Sweden,</hi> which had almoſt prov'd fatal to <hi>Denmark;</hi> his Son <hi>Chriſtian Albert</hi> paid dearly for the ſo much coveted Title of Soveraign, being forc'd to live in Exile for near fourteen Years together; whilſt the Houſe of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> raiſed vaſt Sums out of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to make themſelves ſome Amends for what they had ſuffer'd by his Father's ſiding with their Enemy; tho' it muſt be confeſs'd on the other hand, that this was a ſlender Recompenſe for the Loſs of ſo many fair Provinces, wherewith they were forc'd to buy their Peace from the <hi>Swedes:</hi> A remarkable Inſtance of what Danger attends thoſe Alterations in a State, which ſtrike at the root of its Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the determination of the Differences begun and continued for near fifty years ago, being but now, in all likelihood, left to the longeſt Sword.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> ſeeing themſelves relieved from this Danger, which threatned the utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Monarchy, and being reinforced by the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi>

               </note> and to provide for the Payment of the Souldiers, the <hi>King</hi> call'd together an Aſſembly of the Eſtates towards the beginning of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which began with grea Animoſities, and conſequently with no ſmall Conteſts betwixt the Nobility and Commons; the laſt laying the Calamities ſuſtain'd by the laſt War, and the Occaſion of their impending Danger, chiefly at the door of the Nobles, who ſitting at the Helm, had by their Miſcarriages opened a door to the Enemy, by which to enter into the Heart of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> without oppoſition; On the other hand the Nobles appear'd ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concern'd at the publick Calamity, that tho' they knew the Country exhauſted of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by ſo unexpected an Invaſion, they would not abate an Ace of their pretended Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but were reſolute to lay the whole bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then sof Diſcharging the Souldiers, and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Loſſes ſuſtain'd in the laſt War upon the Shoulders of the two other Eſtates, to wit: The Commonalty and Clergy. This, I ſay, cauſed very warm Debates in the Aſſembly, thoſe, who had behaved themſelves with ſo much Bravery in the Defence of their Capital City and the whole Kingdom, fearing, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, that, after the Danger was paſs'd, they ſhould be bereaved of the fruits of their Victories, and the priviledges promiſed to them in time of Imminent Danger by thoſe very Nobles, who now ſetting aſide all other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56651:18"/>did, according to their wonted Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, conſult more their own Grandeur than the preſent exigency of Affairs. This made <hi>Nanſon,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> and then Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Commons, break out into very ſmart expreſſions, repreſenting to them in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thoſe who had been ſo inſtrumental in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering their Native Country from a Foreign Yoak were likely to be treated by thoſe very Perſons, who had been the occaſion of all the Calamities the Kingdom had groan'd under, for theſe many years paſt; and that the leaſt ſatisfaction they could make at this time, was, to bear an equal Share in thoſe Taxes which muſt of neceſſity be Levied to ſupply the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Neceſſity, and to confirm them in thoſe Priviledges, granted not long before, when any dangerous Enterpriſes were to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Nobles finding themſelves toucht in the moſt ſenſible part, and unwilling to abate any thing from their former Grandeur, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thoſe, whom they look'd upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than their Vaſſals, to ſpeak with ſo much Boldneſs; made very ſevere and bitter Replies to the Speaker, and one <hi>Otto Cragge,</hi> a Man of Great Authority among the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did not ſtick to tell them; <hi>That they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than Slaves, ought to uſe more Reſpect to the Nobility who were reſolved to maintain their Right to the utmoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nanſon</hi> the Speaker perceiving the Commons to be highly offended at theſe words, by a lou'd Murmur which run all over the Hall, aroſe from his Seat, and briskly replied, That <hi>he was well aſſured the Commons would not take the name of Salves from the Nobility, which they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56651:18"/>ſhould ſoon be convinced of to their Coſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Difference betwixt the Nobility and Commons.</note> After which the Aſſembly broke up, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Marched in good order to the <hi>Brewers Hall,</hi> there to conſult how to ſuppreſs the Inſolence of the Nobility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nanſon</hi> then reaſſumed the former Theme, repreſenting to the Commons, how by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management of the Nobility, who had Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it over the <hi>King</hi> and People, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thoſe Calamities, they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone; of which he gave them ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were as yet in freſh Remembrance; and among the reſt, that of the Caſtle of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburgh,</hi> which being the ſtrongeſt and moſt conſiderable Fortreſs of the whole Kingdom, and provided with a ſufficient Garriſon and ſuitable Ammunition was furrendred by the three Governours (being <hi>Daniſh</hi> Noble Men) to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> General <hi>Wrangel,</hi> meerly out of Fear, he having, by diſcharging his Cannon and other demonſtrations of Joy, deceived them into a Belief, that the City of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> was taken by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army. He repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them with what an undaunted Courage they had ſeen their <hi>King</hi> bear the publick Calamities as well as his own, and, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he had expoſed his Perſon, for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and therefore propoſed as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Means to avoid the ſame Dangers they had lately groan'd under, and to deliver themſelves from the Tyrannical Yoak of the Nobility, to ſettle the Crown upon the Antient Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, by declaring the Succeſſion Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and putting the Abſolute Power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Realm into the <hi>King</hi>'s Hands. This Propoſition being approved of by a General
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56651:19"/>Conſent both of the Commonalty and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the execution of it was appointed againſt next Morning; the ſuper-Intendent <hi>Swan,</hi> who Headed the Clergy, and <hi>Nanſon</hi> in the mean while communicated their Deſign to <hi>Hannibal Seaſtede,</hi> then Chief Miniſter of State, and a great Politician. By which means the <hi>King</hi> received notice of the Intenſions of the Commons; but ſuch was his Modeſty, as to declare, that he could not but be extreamly well ſatisfied with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of making the Succeſſion Hereditary, provided the Nobles could be prevailed upon to concur with them; but that he never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Abſolute, nor did think it Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the Kingdom, which thereby might be expoſed to danger hereafter.</p>
            <p>The next Morning no ſooner appear'd, but the Nobles, over ſecure in their own Grandeur, and not in the leaſt imagining that thoſe, whom they had been uſed to Tyrannize over at pleaſure, durſt attempt a thing of ſuch a Nature, met, as uſual, in the Council Houſe, in hopes, that the Commons, after their firſt Heat was ſpent, would be ready to ſubmit to what ſhould be propos'd to them. But ſcarce were they entred upon the Buſineſs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated that day, when word was brought, that the Commons were Marching towards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Chamber to deſire their concurrence, in making an Offer to the <hi>King,</hi> of a Hereditary and Sovereign Dominion.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie to imagine, how great was their Surprize in ſo nice a juncture, conſidering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that they had no leiſure to conſult what was to be done in this preſent Exigency; In the mean while, the two Eſtates being head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56651:19"/>by <hi>Nanſon,</hi> entred the Hall, where the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er told them in a ſhort Speech, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, after mature deliberation, how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kingdom from the many Oppreſſions and Calamities it had ſuffered of late years, had found this the only and moſt expedient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to render the Succeſſion Hereditary, and to Enlarge the Royal Prerogatives; That they deſired their ſpeedy concurrence in the Matter, which if they refuſed, they were reſolved to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. You might have read the Surprize occaſioned by ſo unexpected a Propoſition in every Man's Face, thoſe who the day before had carried themſelves ſo Inſolently towards the Commons, now looking upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with dejected Countenances, finding now too late, that thoſe whom they had look'd upon as Slaves, had put themſelves in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be their Maſters, by engaging the Court, Clergy and Army into their Party. In the midſt of thoſe Diſtractions, the Commons inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peremptorily upon an Anſwer, they told them, that what had been done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in favour of the Royal Family and the Publick Good, was very acceptable to them; That they were willing to concur with the Commons in ſo good a Work, but deſire only ſome ſmall time, to conſider, how to proceed with that Precaution, as was abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the Accompliſhment of a Thing of ſuch vaſt Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe Debates laſted, the Nobility had found means to ſend ſome Deputies to Court, (unknown to the Commons) who being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the King's preſence, told him in the Name of the whole Body of the Nobility; That
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56651:20"/>the Propoſition made to them by the Commons, of making the Monarchy Hereditary, had been ſo ſudden and unexpected, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to proceed in an Affair of ſuch Moment with ſo much Deliberation,<note place="margin">Offer of the Crown to be Hereditary to the Heirs Males.</note> as the Caſe requir'd; but that however, to ſhew their Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Concurring with the other Eſtates in any thing which might be thought conducing to the Publick Good, and the Advancement of the Royal Family, they were ſent to make a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Crown to be Hereditary for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to His Majeſty and His Heirs Males; which as it proceeded from a pure Senſe of their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to His Majeſty, ſo they hoped he would accept of the Offer, and engage the Commons to join with them in ſo Great and U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56651:20"/>to preſcribe them Rules in a Caſe, which he was ſenſible was in their Diſpoſal, but adviſed them to take it into more ſerious Conſideration; which done, he ſhould be willing to concur with them in any thing, which ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the General Conſent of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as conducing to the Advancement of the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer of the King has furniſhed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Matter to the Politicians to reflect upon the Conduct of the Nobility, it being agreed on by all hands, that, provided they had at this Juncture made a ſeaſonable Tender of an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Crown, without Excluſion of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and had with a Courage becoming their Grandeur, join'd with the Commons in making this Offer, they might for the reſt, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what they pleas'd from the King, or at leaſt prevented their Ruin, by preſerving ſome of their Priviledges and Liberties, it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the King's Anſwer, given to <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Seaſtede,</hi> after the firſt Intention of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was known, that his Aim was not at the Abſolute Soveraignty, but (as he told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Nobility) to have the Crown ſettled upon the ſame Terms as it had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by his Anceſtors; but the Nobles being diſtracted with the Surprize of the ſuddenneſs of the Thing, and the Conſternation occaſioned by the imminent Danger of parting with their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Prerogatives, they, whilſt they let ſlip this Opportunity of ſaving a Part, were the unhappy Inſtruments of loſing the Whole, as will appear out of the Sequel of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56651:21"/>
            <p>For, whilſt they were in Expectation of the Return of their Deputies, the Comons, who began to be ſuſpicious of this Delay, ſhew'd a great deal of Impatience, and when the Nobles deſir'd a little more time to conſult about an Affair of ſo Great Weight, the Preſident told th m roundly; That the Commons were not ſo blind, as not to perceive that theſe were only Shifts, invented by the Nobility, to gain Time and Opportunity to thwart their Deſign; That therefore, if they were willing to join with them in the Reſolution taken by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they were ready, if not, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make the Offer without their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; which the Nobles, being unwilling to comply with, the Commons, headed by the Biſhop and the Speaker, went forthwith to Court,<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons offer the Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King told them, that ſuch a Tender as this could not but be Grateful to him, eſpecially from his Subjects, who had given him ſuch ample Teſtimonies of their Fidelity and Valour ſo lately, in defending his Perſon, Royal Family and the Kingdom; that all this ſhould remain in conſtant Remembrance with him, and they might reſt aſſured of his Royal Protection,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56651:21"/>and all the Encouragement due to the Merits of ſuch good Subjects; But it was abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, before he could accept of their Offer, the Nobles ſhould concur with them (as he had all the Reaſon to believe they would) in this Point, for which Reaſon, it would be neceſſary they ſhould continue their Seſſion, till the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, after a mature Deliberation, might join with them in ſetling the deſign'd Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting at Court,<note place="margin">The Nobility in great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction.</note> the Nobles were at the greateſt Plunge what to reſolve upon at this critical Juncture; They knew the Commons were gone to Court without them, and their Deputies had brought them by this time the unwelcome News of their ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which put them into ſuch a Diſtraction, that it was reſolv'd, to Adjourn the further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the Matter till next day. In the mean while, ſome of their Body, who began to dread the Event, took this Opportunity to ſlip privately out of Town. This was not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly done, but that ſome of the leading Men of the Adverſe Party, having got Scent of it, and fearing that the reſt, encouraged by their Example, might fruſtrate their Deſign, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into their reſpective Countries, it was propoſed to the King, as the only Means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the breaking up the Seſſion in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner, to Order the Gates of the City to be kept ſhut up, till the Matter might be brought to a Concluſion; Orders being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſent to the Governour <hi>Schacht</hi> (who was in the Intereſt of the Commons, and had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd himſelf lately in the Defence of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) it was immediately put in execution, by the Town Mayor.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56651:22"/>
            <p>Moſt of the Nobles happened to be the ſame Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon at the Funeral of one of the Chiefeſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> Senators,<note place="margin">Their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</note> which in thoſe Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are Solemniz'd with a great deal of Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and very good Cheer; Whilſt they were driving away Sorrows by letting the Bumpers go round briskly, enters the Town Mayor (he being alſo invited to aſſiſt at the Solemnity) and, after the firſt Glaſs, told him who ſat next to him at the Table, that the Gates of the City were ſhut up; ſo odd and unexpected a piece of News being ſoon Whiſpered round the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they began all on a ſudden to change their Countenances, being ſeiſed with dreadful Apprehenſions; and looking upon the Town Mayor no otherwiſe than the Meſſenger of Death, they began one after another to ask what Deſtiny was prepared for them; The May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who was ſcarce able to keep his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (when he ſaw thoſe who had ſo lately Lorded it both over King and People, ſeiſed with a Panick Fear upon ſuch an Occaſion as this) told them, that they made a wrong Judgment of the King's Intentions, whoſe Actions had been always ſuch, as not to give them the leaſt room, to ſuſpect any ſiniſter Accident; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Gates had been ſhut by the King's Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Order, but that he believed they needed not fear any thing, the King's Intention being, that they ſhould purſue the Publick Buſineſs they were met about.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer of the Mayor ſeemed in ſome meaſure to revive their drooping Spirits, but did not remove the Remnants of Fear; For, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with themſelves, that if they ſhould perſiſt any longer in their Refuſal of complying with the Commons, they might lay hold of this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56651:22"/>Opportunity to revenge themſelves for the Wrongs receiv'd at their hands, by calling them to an Account for thoſe many paſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and the enſuing Calamities, which they were ſenſible they would lay at their doors, eſpecially at this Juncture, when they were back'd by the Court and Army. The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of theſe dreadful Conſequences, (which were not altogether groundleſs) being more prevailing upon them than the Conſideration of the Loſs of their Priviledges and Liberty, it was judg'd abſolutely neceſſary (after ſome ſhort Conſultations, ſuch as the Time and Place could allow of) that ſince they had miſs'd the laſt Opportunity of making Terms for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Commons.</note> to make an Abſolute Reſignation of all, by complying with the Commons; of which Reſolution they gave immediate Notice, by ſome deputed out of their own Body, to the King and the other Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The King having accepted their offer, and willing that the Homage ſhould be performed with all the Solemnity that poſſibly could be upon ſo extaordinary an Occaſion, ordered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to be got ready for it, in order to which, a large Scaffold was erected in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Palace, upon which the King, Queen and Royal Family being mounted on the 27. <hi>October,</hi> and placed upon Chairs under Canopies richly Adorned, received the Homage of the Senators,<note place="margin">They Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render their priviledges and liberty.</note> Nobility, the Chief of the Clergy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in the preſence of the Citizens of <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi> and the Garriſon, who appeared all in Arms in their beſt Apparel.</p>
            <p>It was one of the moſt ſurpriſing things in the World, to ſee thoſe very Men, who but a few days before had carried things on with ſo much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56651:23"/>Haughtineſs, to reſign ſo tamely at once all their Priviledges, which they had been raiſing to that pitch of Greatneſs, as to become inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to the Kingdom, by a continued Series of Deſigns for ſeveral Ages paſt; it being very remarkable, that among all theſe Perſons of Quality and Birth, there was not one, who, during thoſe three days, that were taken up with making the neceſſary Preparations for this Solemnity, attempted by proteſtation or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to ſhew his Senſe of the Loſs of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Liberty, for which they ſtood Chiefly indebted to their own ill Conduct and Inſolent Behaviour.</p>
            <p>I was the more willing to trace the true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin of the Antient <hi>Daniſh</hi> Monarchy, and the Cauſes of its Various changes, to ſhew the World by what Steps the Nobility arrived to that pitch of Greatneſs, which at once proved the Occaſion of their Fall, and of many other Miſchiefs which have either preceded or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and which will inſenſibly lead us into the better knowledge of the true State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, under the Reign of their late King <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> V. whoſe Life and Reign we are to give you an Account of in the following Chapters; from whence it will appear, that, as at the beginning of his Reign he found the Kingdom involved in no ſmall Troubles, occaſioned by the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thoſe who could not be ſo ſoon forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their <hi>Darling Grandeur,</hi> and by the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from a Potent neighbouring Enemy, ſo he ſtruggled thro' all theſe Obſtacles with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Conſtancy, till he left the Kingdom in a much better Condition to his Son, <hi>Frederick</hi> IV. who lately aſcended the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Throne.</p>

               <p>KING <hi>Frederick</hi> III. had by <hi>Sophia Aemilia</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> a Numerous Iſſue, to wit: Two Princes and four Princeſſes.

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. after he ſaw himſelf delivered from his Foreign Enemies by the late Peace, and from the inteſtine Diviſions by the late remarkable Revolution, applied all his Care in reſtoring the decayed State of the Kingdom, by new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling his Army, and putting his Frontier Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a State of Defence. The Education of his eldeſt Son <hi>Chriſtian</hi> he committed to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of <hi>Otto Skade,</hi> his Governour, one of the Senators of the Kingdom; and to the Sieur <hi>Matheſius,</hi> his Tutor, afterwards <hi>Daniſh</hi> Reſident in the City of <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1655, the ſaid Prince was by the States of <hi>Denmark</hi> declared Succeſſor to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Frederick</hi> in that Kingdom; and ſoon after receiv'd Homage accordingly at <hi>Wiburgh</hi> in <hi>Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The States of <hi>Norway</hi> following their Example, performed the ſame in the following Year 1656, at <hi>Chriſtiania,</hi> the Capital City of that Kingdom; whither he was ſent in the Year
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56651:24"/>1661 (the next after the Great Revolution) with a good Squadron of Men of War, under the Conduct of the then Lord Treaſurer, <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Seaſtede,</hi> the Lord Chancellor <hi>Reets,</hi> and the Archbiſhop <hi>Hans Swana,</hi> to receive Homage of the States, as Hereditary Prince.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Frederick</hi> having obſerved in this young Prince a moſt particular Inclination to Martial Exploits, during the laſt Siege of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi> where being animated by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Conſtancy and Bravery of his Father,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian V.</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</note> he had given ſuch ſingular Proofs of his active Spirit, as far ſurpaſſed his Age; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to give all poſſible Encouragement to his Noble Deſigns, which were to improve himſelf by Travelling in foreign Countries, he ſent him abroad in the Year 1662, under the Conduct of <hi>Chriſtopher Parsberg,</hi> a Perſon, who had ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd himſelf by his Great Experience in the Management of Matters of the higheſt Moment, in Conſideration of which, he was afterwards dignified with the Title of an Earl, and that of Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Denmark.</hi> They took their Way by Land through the united Provinces, and the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> where after having taken a View of the Chief Cities of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, they arriv'd at <hi>Calais</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> towards the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> where being met by ſeveral Yatchs, ſent by <hi>Charles</hi> II. then King of <hi>England,</hi> they took the firſt Opportunity of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting themſelves into this Kingdom, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd ſafely in a few days after at <hi>London.</hi> Here he receiv'd the Compliments of the Chiefeſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility (being lodg'd in <hi>Exeter-Houſe,</hi> and defrayed at the King's Charge) and having viſited both our Univerſities, and being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56651:25"/>created a Knight Companion of the moſt Noble Order of the Garter, he return'd, after a Stay of two Months, by the Way of <hi>Dover</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> There was at that time reſiding in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Quality of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, the beforementioned <hi>Hanibal Scaſtede,</hi> who, had made himſelf remarkable by his Conduct in Managing the late Revolution in <hi>Denmark.</hi> Prince <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was lodged in the ſaid Ambaſſadours Pallace, where he received the Viſits of all the Princes of the Blood, and of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in particular; and before his departure from that City, was preſented by the King with a Sword and Belt ſet with Diamonds. After a ſtay of twelve Months in <hi>France,</hi> he left <hi>Paris,</hi> in order to purſue his Journey to <hi>Italy,</hi> but by ſpecial Command from his Father King <hi>Frederick,</hi> was ſtop't at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to return thro' <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among other Courts of the Princes of the Empire, he viſited that of <hi>William Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen Caſſel,</hi> where he fell in Love with that incomparable Princeſs <hi>Charlotta Aemilia,</hi> the Daughter of the ſaid <hi>Landgrave;</hi> ſo that after his return into <hi>Denmark,</hi> he would not reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till he had obtained his Royal Father's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Marry that Princeſs; which Match was conſummated at the Royal Seat of <hi>Amalienburgh,</hi> on the tenth day of <hi>May</hi> in the year 1667.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. happening to die towards the latter end of the year 1669. was ſucceeded by his eldeſt Son <hi>Chriſtian</hi> V. who found the Kingdom involved in great Troubles, by reaſon of the ill State of the Kingdom, quite exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the late unſucceſsful Wars, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Taxes which were of Neceſſity to be laid
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56651:25"/>upon the People to Maintain a ſufficient Force againſt the Danger that threatned them from an Enemy, whoſe Power being encreaſed of late, by their loſſes, they had all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Fear would for the future Improve the Antient Hatred betwixt thoſe two Northern Nations, to his Advantage. For, after the <hi>Swedes</hi> had once found Means to untie the Knot of that Union which was in former Ages made betwixt theſe Northern Crowns,<note place="margin">The State of <hi>Denmark</hi> after the death of King <hi>Frederick.</hi>
                  </note> they made ſuch Encroachments upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as (by degrees) to render themſelves formidable to all <hi>Europe;</hi> whereas ſome Ages before, they were ſcarce in a Condition to Cope with <hi>Denmark</hi> alone. For they Wreſted <hi>Carelia</hi> out of the Hands of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> which ſerves them for a Bulwark on the ſide of <hi>Finland;</hi> the like they did with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Ingermanland, Eſthen</hi> and <hi>Liefland,</hi> all very Fertile Countries, the laſt being the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of <hi>Swedeland.</hi> The City of <hi>Riga,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of <hi>Liefland,</hi> Situate upon the River <hi>Duina,</hi> being of the utmoſt Conſequence to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Crown, by reaſon of its Commerce with <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy, Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Courland.</hi> But what is to be look'd upon as the moſt Conſiderable of all, were their late Conqueſts on the ſide of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> in the firſt they had extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Limits to the Mountains that divide that Kingdom from <hi>Sweden,</hi> by making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the two Provinces of <hi>Jempter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Hchrendahlen;</hi> in the laſt they had Guarded their Frontiers by the Conqueſt of the Provinces of <hi>Halland, Bleckingen, Shonen,</hi> and <hi>Bahus;</hi> the three firſt of which being Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the other ſide of the <hi>Sound,</hi> and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56651:26"/>laſt juſt above it, and conſequently Oppoſite to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Shoar. The Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which formerly lay Expoſed to the <hi>Danes</hi> for above fifty Leagues together, has, by making the <hi>Sound</hi> the common Foundary of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions on that ſide, ſecured it ſelf againſt any Attempt of the <hi>Danes,</hi> which, as the Caſe now ſtands, cannot be undertaken thereabouts without a vaſt Charge and great Hazard.</p>
               <p>The Acquiſitions of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> have been look'd upon by ſome as of no great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to them, by reaſon of their great diſtance, they being not to be ſuccoured by that Crown, but by the <hi>Baltick;</hi> which occaſioned a warm Debate among the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Senators, at the time of the <hi>Weſt phalian</hi> Treaty; ſome among them being of Opinion, that becauſe they could ſcarce be maintain'd without a great deal of Trouble, they would rather be a Burthen, than an Advantage to them; and adviſed therefore, that another equivalent would turn to a much better Account, than thoſe remote Provinces, which, in time, by the Jealouſy of its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes, might entangle them in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War, at a great diſtance from Home. But thoſe who were of another Sentiment, urg'd, that they ought not to let ſlip ſo favourable an Opportunity to get a firm footing in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by annexing thoſe Provinces with the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which would entitle them to a conſiderable Share in the Management of the Affairs of <hi>Europe;</hi> that by being poſſeſs'd of the ſtrong City, and Port of <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> and the Maritim Cities of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> they had a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to encreaſe their Naval Strength, and to keep a Communication in the <hi>Baltick.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56651:26"/>But what moſt of all turn'd the Ballance on the ſide of the laſt, was, that from the Dukedom of <hi>Bremen,</hi> they might attack <hi>Denmark</hi> in its moſt ſenſible and beſt Part on the <hi>German</hi> ſide, where the Territories of both the Northern Crowns are divided only by the River <hi>Elbe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> had been made ſenſible of the Truth of this Maxim to their Coſt, in the late War of 1657, 1658, the Smart of which was ſo freſh in their Memory, that King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> V. immediately after his Acceſſion to the Throne, made it his Chiefeſt care to put his Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs into ſuch a Poſture, as to be able to Cope with ſo potent a Neighbour, whenever occaſion ſhould offer; for which purpoſe, he ommitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he thought might contribute to the Defence of the Kingdom, by raiſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing Fortifications in all ſuch Places as were moſt expoſed to the Attacks of an Enemy, and introducing a good Martial Diſcipline among his Troops, under the Command of experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and faithful Officers, being for the moſt part <hi>Germans.</hi> But there was another Obſtacle, which, as it was near home, ſo it was the more Dangerous; This was the Jealouſy conceiv'd at the Proceedings of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp,</hi> who owing his Soveraignty over the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> obtained by the Treaty of <hi>Roſhilt,</hi> to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> was ſuppoſed to ſtand in a good Correſpondence with that Crown, the better to maintain himſelf in the Poſſeſſion of it. 'Tis true, the <hi>Danes</hi> endeavoured by giving one of their Princeſſes in Marriage to the ſaid Duke, to link him again to their Intereſt; but as the Ties of Matrimony very ſeldom ſtand in competition with Intereſt (eſpecially
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56651:27"/>among Princes) ſo this Alliance was ſo far from anſwering the deſired Effect, that the <hi>Danes</hi> found every day new Matter of Jealouſy at the Duke's Proceedings, which at laſt broke out into a Rupture, which is not compoſed to this day; And theſe Domeſtick Diviſions have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been in agitation for above theſe twenty Years laſt paſt, and are at this time the Chief Entertainment of <hi>Europe,</hi> we will trace its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin in the following Chapter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>To ſearch to the root of thoſe Diferences, we muſt go back as far as the Year 1449, when <hi>Chriſtian</hi> I. Earl of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> and <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menhorſt,</hi> being elected King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> (and afterwards likewiſe of <hi>Sweden</hi>) <hi>Adolph</hi> his Uncle by the Mother-ſide, was Duke of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and Earl of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the firſt being a Fief of the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> at leaſt five hundred Years before, the laſt a Fief of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Adolph</hi> dying without Iſſue, King <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> I. ſucceeded him both in <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> and he dying in the Year 1481, left two Sons behind him, <hi>John,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the Northern Kingdoms, and <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was afterwards elected King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the depoſed King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> II. Son to King <hi>John.</hi> After the Death of King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> I. <hi>Dorothy</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> his Queen Relict, being a very Politick Woman, who had a moſt powerful Influence upon the Eſtates of thoſe Dukedoms, and being extreamly fond of her younger Son, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſaid Eſtates, that by vertue of a peculiar Priviledge granted to them by King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> I. at the time of his Acceſſion to the Throne of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and afterwards to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56651:28"/>Dukedoms; and according to his Laſt Will and Teſtament (the laſt of which was found defective) it was in their Power to chuſe, which of his Sons they liked beſt, for their Prince. <hi>John</hi> the elder Brother, at the Aſſembly of the Eſtates in the City of <hi>Kiel,</hi> repreſented to them that his Mothers Demand in behalf of his younger Brother <hi>Frederick,</hi> was directly oppoſite to the <hi>Feudatory</hi> Laws both of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Empire, by vertue of which the eldeſt Son had an unqueſtionable Right of Succeſſion, which had been confirmed by the Practice of many Ages. He alledged, and not without great Reaſon, That the Northern Crowns being then elective, if by a more powerful Intereſt, or any other Siniſter Accident his Poſterity ſhould be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from theſe Crowns, they would be left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, whilſt the younger Houſe enjoyed the Inheritance of Great and plentiful Territories. Theſe Reaſons, founded upon true Matter of Fact, wrought ſo powerfully upon the Eſtates (who before were for excluding <hi>John</hi> from the Succeſſion) that to ſatisfie in ſome meaſure the juſt Demands of the eldeſt Brother, and to ſhew their Paſſion for the younger, and the Queen his Mother, they pitch'd upon this Expedient, to divide the ſaid two Dukedoms, Share and ſhare alike, betwixt the two Brothers. But their fundamental Conſtitution, being built upon this Bottom, that they ſhould for ever remain entire, without being divided or diſmembred, the ſaid Diviſion was made under certain Conditions of a perpetual <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak frequently here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56651:28"/>
               <p>Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> being after the Depoſition of his Nephew <hi>King Chriſtian</hi> II. Elected <hi>King,</hi> the two Dutchies of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>United with the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the States being by this Time made Senſible of the Inconveniences ariſen from this Diviſion, (tho' under the ſtricteſt Union that could be) obtained from the ſaid <hi>King Frederick,</hi> immediately after his Acceſſion to the Throne, to Sign an Act, confirmed by his Oath, That thoſe Dutchies ſhould for ever after be one inſeparable entire Body. But his Son and Succeſſor King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> III. a Prince, who had a great deal of Tenderneſs for his younger Brothers, did, notwithſtanding this, fall into the ſame Error; and in the Year 1544, make another Diviſion of thoſe two Dukedoms betwixt himſelf and his two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Adolph;</hi> the youngeſt of all, whoſe Name was <hi>Frederick,</hi> being provided for by ſeveral good Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Biſhopricks of <hi>Hildeſheim</hi> and <hi>Sleſwick;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, he was Co-adjutor to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bremen:</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the ſecond of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happening to die not long after without Iſſue, his Share was again divided betwixt King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> III. and his Brother <hi>Adolph,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Branch of the Family, which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> Line.</p>

                  </note> contrary to the expreſs Act and Oath of <hi>King Frederick</hi> I. And the Eſtates exclaiming againſt a Procedure, which ſtruck at the very Root of their fundamental Conſtitution; <hi>K.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> to ſatisfy both his Father's Intention and his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56651:29"/>own Inclinations, which were bent to favour his Brothers. For this purpoſe, it was agreed, not only betwixt the King and Kingdom of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and the ſaid Dukes, but alſo betwixt the ſeveral Dukes in reſpect to one another (as the Words of the ſaid Union in the low <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue expreſs it in plain Terms) That there ſhould be a perpetual and inſeperable <hi>

               <p>King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> III. being Senſible,<note place="margin">Reaſons for his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</note> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt Injuſtice in the World, he could not diſmember the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> from <hi>Denmark,</hi> being the Bulwark of that Kingdom on the <hi>German</hi> ſide, thought by this Means to Preſerve the Soveraignty of it to that Crown, and by the ſtrict Tie and Union of a joint Government and Mutual Defence betwixt them, to provide for the Security of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56651:29"/>This is that Famous Union, made in the Year 1533, betwixt the King and Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> on one ſide, and the Dukes of <hi>Holſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> on the other, as the preſent Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein Gottorp</hi>'s Miniſters would have it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Danes</hi> alledge that it was not only made betwixt the King and the Duke's, as King, but alſo as Duke of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> from thoſe Words in the Patent of the Union; <hi>Wherefore we altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one for another, both ſides, as likewiſe each in his own behalf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Union was Confirmed,<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion renewed.</note> Enlarg'd and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in the Year 1623, betwixt <hi>Christian</hi> IV. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein Gottorp,</hi> when, among other things it was expreſly Agreed on, That their Poſterity ſhould be obliged to renew this Union at the time of their firſt Acceſſion to the Regency, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from the Copy of the ſaid Union, Printed by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi>'s Order, in the Year 1696.

               </head>
               <p>THE Precautions taken by the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of thoſe two Houſes, to Unite them both in Point of Intereſt and Government, did at laſt prove too Weak to ſubſiſt without a remarkable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; For, after <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had abdicated that Kingdom, <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi> her Couſin, Prince Palatine of <hi>Deuxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponts</hi> ſucceeded her; a Man of whom it muſt be confeſs'd, that he was Endowed with all Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, becoming a King; but withal of an unmeaſurable Ambition,<note place="margin">Ambiti n of <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi> King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </note> and whoſe Deſigns were as great as ever any of the greateſt Hero's of Antiquity: To confirm which, I cannot paſs by in ſilence, what Monſieur <hi>Terlon,</hi> who was Ambaſſadour of the <hi>French</hi> King to both the Northern Crowns, about that time, ſays in his Memoirs concerning <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who ſpeaking one day of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> in his preſence, ſaid: <hi>As ſoon as I have Conquer'd them, all the other Princes and States will be glad to be quiet, and not trouble themſelves to Reſtore the King of</hi> Denmark; <hi>and whilſt they are buſie to out-vie one another by Traffick, I will find a way, what with the Alliances already made, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56651:30"/>ſome others, to unite thoſe Conqueſts with, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh my ſelf ſo well in</hi> Sweden, <hi>as to make all the Neighbouring Countries, nay even thoſe at a great diſtance, dread <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> He uſed often to ſay, and ſo would the Earl of <hi>Slippenbach,</hi> continues Monſieur <hi>Terlon: When I once have made My ſelf Maſter of the North, I will go with a very Potent Army and Fleet, like a ſecond</hi> Alaric, <hi>to</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, <hi>to force</hi> Rome <hi>to ſubmit its Neck once more under the Yoak of the</hi> Goths. And to ſpeak the Truth, if we reflect upon the Great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of this King, his Actions were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſutiable to the Character given him by this Ambaſſadour; that he was as active in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Council, as he was in the Camp.</p>
               <p>Among other Projects which were contriv'd to compaſs his Great Deſigns,<note place="margin">His Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Duke of <hi>Holſtein's</hi> Daughter.</note> one of the moſt refined Pieces of Policy, was his Marriage with <hi>Hedwig Eleonore,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Fredereick</hi> Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp;</hi> For, being ſenſible that without the Conqueſt of <hi>Denmark,</hi> he could not promiſe himſelf any Conſiderable Succeſs againſt the Empire, he did not queſtion, but by this Alliance to draw that Duke into his Party; by which Means he might facilitate his Conqueſt on that ſide, and bereave the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in ſome meaſure, of the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Princes of the Empire; or, at leaſt to put ſuch a Thorn in his Foot, by the Neighbourhood of this Duke, as would diſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to ſtir, whilſt he was putting his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in execution againſt <hi>Poland.</hi>

                  </note> no ſooner had he ſecur'd himſelf on that ſide, but he began to make Preparations for the Enterprize againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> upon a very weak Pretence; and notwithſtanding they ſent an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56651:31"/>Ambaſſadour to his Court, who offered all the Satisfaction that reaſonably could be deſired, and that in very ſubmiſſive Terms; he, not long after entred that Kingdom with his Army, where he carried All before him: Theſe incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Progreſſes, but eſpecially his Conqueſts in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> opened the Eyes of All the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who now began plainly to ſee, that his Aim was no leſs than to be Maſter of the Whole <hi>Baltick.

               <p>It is therefore to be obſerved, that after <hi>King Charles Guſtave</hi> had taken a Reſolution to finiſh the Conqueſt of <hi>Denmark</hi> by the taking of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> he feared, not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Allies of <hi>Denmark</hi> might March to its Relief, before he could be Maſter of a Place, which in all likelihood would defend its ſelf to the laſt Extremity; As he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the imaginable Precautions to prevent the coming of any Succours by Sea, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Fleet into the <hi>Sound,</hi> and Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Paſſage with ſtrong Chains, ſo the only Means to ſecure himſelf againſt any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Allies by Land, was to make himſelf Maſter of the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Renſburgh,</hi> ſituate upon the River <hi>Eyder,</hi> on the

               <p>The only Way then left them being to try their Fortune by another Way, the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> was prevailed upon to ſend ſome of his Miniſters thither to endeavour to perſwade hem by a voluntary Surrender.</p>
               <p>Accordingly ſeveral Perſons being deputed by the Duke, and amongſt them the Father of the Governour of the Place (being then in the Duke's Service) they deſired a Conference with the Governour and Magiſtrates of the City, without mentioning the leaſt what Errand they came about; ſo being admitted into the City, they in a very pathetick Harangue, repreſented unto them the dangerous Condition the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> was in at that time; which having moved the Duke to take Compaſſion of them, had ſent his Deputation to exhort them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their impending Ruine by a timely Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, which if done, he would provide for their Security, by putting a ſufficient Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in the place, not queſtioning, but that he would obtain a Neutrality for them from his Son-in-Law, the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Magiſtrates thank'd the Duke for his Care; but withal, told the Deputies, that,<note place="margin">Faithfulneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

               </head>
               <p>KING <hi>Frederick</hi> III. had ſome Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the young Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> having got every thing he deſired, would now reſt ſatisfied with his new Acquiſitions, and cultivate a good Underſtanding with <hi>Denmark</hi> for the future, but this had a quite contrary Effect; For, the Duke thinking it not for his Intereſt to conſide in thoſe, whom he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd ſo lately, took other meaſures; and in the beginning of the Year 1661, not long after the Peace of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> entred into a new and a more ſtrict Alliance with <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Denmark</hi> taking the Alarm at this Proceeding,<note place="margin">Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein.</hi>
                  </note> it was repreſented by the Duke's Miniſters, as a defenſive Alliance, made for no other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to ſecure their new Aquiſitions againſt any Attempts that might be made upon them from <hi>Denmark,</hi> there being one expreſs Article inſerted, That the ſame ſhould not be prejudicial to the Friendſhip betwixt thoſe two Families. But tho' it was true, that the ſaid Alliance was penn'd in defenſive Terms, yet were the two Articles inſerted, which would admit of no other Interpretation, than to have been contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56651:36"/>to the great Prejudice of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt was: That in caſe the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> ſhould, beyond all expectation, recede from the laſt Northern Peace, and came to the worſt of the War, which he ſhould draw upon him by ſo doing; That in ſuch a Caſe, the Duke did reſerve to himſelf all his Right and Title to the Royal Part of thoſe Dukedoms, both for himſelf and his Poſterity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That the Duke does expreſly agree with his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> That, if in Caſe of a Rupture betwixt the two Northern Crowns, that Part of the Dukedoms belonging to <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſhall oblige its ſelt to ſtand Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo, as that not the leaſt Injury or Danger may from thence accrue to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the ſaid King obliges himſelf not to attack or moleſt them.</p>
               <p>Both thoſe Points could not but ſtick very cloſe in the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Stomach; for to pretend to ſecure the Succeſſion of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, when there were at leaſt twenty Princes of the Royal Branch alive, who had an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Precedency before the Branch of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein Gottorp,</hi> could not but be conſidered as very foreign to a defenſive Alliance; The ſecond tending to no leſs than to abalienate the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Subjects from the Allegiance due to their Sovereigns, without his Approbation, as it had a near Relation to the firſt, ſo the <hi>Danes</hi> could take it for no leſs than a ſtrong Preſumption to ſhew how eager the Duke was of getting into the entire Poſſeſſion of thoſe Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; but the Remembrance of their late Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and their unſetled State at home, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by that Great Revolution, obliged
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56651:36"/>them to paſs by thoſe things till a better Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>The Duke on the other hand, being fluſh'd by this new Alliance, and by the weakneſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> too this Juncture as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to promote his Intereſt; and being put to a great Nonplus, how to maintain thoſe Forces that were to be kept on foot for their Mutual Defence, purſuant to this Alliance (his ordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues being inſufficient) it was propoſed to <hi>Denmark,</hi> that thoſe Taxes,<note place="margin">The Dukes incrcach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> which uſed to be levied for the common defence of the Country, and were kept in one common Treaſury (to prevent the liſting of Soldiers without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both Parties) ſhould not be put in the common Rank, but that each party might have Power to collect and keep his own Share.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> were not ſo inſenſible as not to perceive the Duke's Intention, but as they were not in a Condition to break with <hi>Sweden</hi> at that time, ſo, after many Conteſtations, they ſaw themſelves under a Neceſſity to comply with the Duke's deſire in the Year 1663. under this Limitation however, that it ſhould be only for a certain time, and not be made uſe of hereafter in prejudice of either ſide; for which reaſon alſo the ſaid Treaſury was not ſhut up, but the Taxes raiſed upon the Noble Men's Eſtates were to be paid in there, as before.</p>
               <p>The Duke got a remarkable Advantage by this Conceſſion, being now at liberty to pay his own Troops, who were to ſwear Fealty to him alone; beſides, that the <hi>Danes</hi> being to provide moſt of the Garriſon'd Places (which belong'd to their Share) the Taxes were not ſufficient to anſwer the Charges they were of Neceſſity to be at.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56651:37"/>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having in the mean while, in ſome meaſure, re-ſetled his Affairs at home, began to make preſſing Inſtances to the Duke, to ſettle the Gathering and Management of the extraordinary Taxes upon the antient Foundation; but he being unwilling to part with it, new Pretenſions were made, founded upon the Patent of King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> I. who firſt divided <hi>Sleſwick</hi> betwixt his Sons, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick;</hi> in which it is expreſs'd, <hi>That the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Tax,</hi> (call'd <hi>the Land Bede</hi>) <hi>ſhould be divided equally amongst them.</hi> But this Argument could ſtand them in little ſtead, conſidering that the whole Dukedom was re-united with the Crown under King <hi>Frederick</hi> I. whoſe Sons (from whom both the Branches of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> are deſcended) made a new Diviſion and Union, in which there is not the leaſt of it mentioned. Whilſt theſe Conteſts laſted, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> were engag'd in a War in the Year 1665, when King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. in remembrance of what he owed to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for their ſeaſonable Relief at the time of the late Siege of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> gave ſhelter to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Ships in the Port of <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> the then <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral; who being vehemently exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated againſt him, and endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Swedes</hi> to break with <hi>Denmark,</hi> he did not think it ſeaſonable to puſh this Point of the Community of Taxes to the utmoſt, but rather to link the ſaid Duke to his Intereſt by a Marriage with his Daughter <hi>Frederica Amalia,</hi>

               <p>But it ſeems the Ties of Marriage were not ſtrong enough to draw him from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; for, in the Year 1669, there being a Meeting appointed at <hi>Hamborough</hi> betwixt the Deputies of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> in order to compoſe the Differences ariſen betwixt the King and Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> on one, and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen,</hi> on the other ſide, about the Succeſſion in the Countries of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt;</hi> the Deputies of <hi>Gottorp</hi> ſhew'd ſo much Haughtineſs in their deportment, that the firſt Commiſſioner of the Duke diſputed the Precedency with the ſecond Commiſſioner of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and ſhew'd their Orders for ſo doing; and tho' the Imperial Commiſſioner, who aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at thoſe Conferences, employed all his Care and Authority to terminate thoſe Differences in an Amicable manner, yet the Miniſters of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi> were ſo far from hearkning to thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that they at ſeveral times threatned both the Emperour and the Empire with the <hi>Swedes;</hi> ſo that this Negotiation broke off fruitleſs.</p>

               <p>AFter the Concluſion of the Treaty at <hi>Renſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holstein Gottorp,</hi> did not remain long in the ſame Sentiment; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was made with certain Pamphlets, in which the Tranſaction of <hi>Renſburgh,</hi> were Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the blackeſt Colours imaginable; at which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> being extreamly Surpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, writ in very Obliging Terms to the Duke, to know whether thoſe Things had been done with his Conſent, and, if not, to ſhew his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment both againſt thoſe Pamphlets and the Authors of them. The Duke anſwering in very ambiguous terms; the King ſent him word, that ſince he deny'd him ſo reaſonable a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he could not take it amiſs, if he did,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56651:51"/>ſo much Juſtice both to his Perſon and Himſelf, as to ſecure thoſe, who were the Authors and fomenters of thoſe Diviſions and Miſchiefs, which he proteſted he was conſtrained to by an abſolute Neceſſity to prevent a further Rupture betwixt the two Houſes, and as a Teſtimony of his ſincere Inclinations towards the Duke, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Garriſon, which he kept in <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> to be removed from thence, offering to give him all further Security he could deſire.</p>
               <p>The Duke was ſo alarm'd at this Propoſal,<note place="margin">The Duke ſlies to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> that, being then at <hi>Eutin</hi> with his Brother the Biſhop of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> inſtead of returning to <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp,</hi> his ordinary Reſidence, he went to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> where he was no ſooner arriv'd, but he began to call in queſtion the Legality of the Treaty of <hi>Renſburgh,</hi> and within a Year and a Half after, declared it null and void; He offered however, to receive the Inveſtiture of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> provided the King would give him Satisfaction concerning certain Points, which being contrary to the ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the King would not hearken to, or at leaſt, not before he had received the ſaid Inveſtiture.</p>
               <p>Things continued for ſome time in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, whilſt the Queen Dowager of <hi>Denmark</hi> employed all her Authority and good Offices with her Son-in-Law the Duke, to perſwade him to a Compliance with his Majeſty's Deſires, purſuant to the Treaty of <hi>Renſburgh;</hi> but the Duke perſiſting in his former Reſolution, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> made a Sequeſtration of the Ducal Share of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging for his Juſtification, to be entitled to it, by the Duke's being from his Vaſſal, become his Enemy. This Sequeſtration continued till
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56651:51"/>the beforementioned Peace, made at <hi>Fountain-Bleau,</hi> in which there being inſerted an Article, in Favour of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> this gave birth to new Troubles. For, the Duke's Miniſters interpreted thoſe Words in the ſaid Article, That <hi>whatever has been done and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſince, ſhall not be drawn into Conſequence in Oppoſition to thoſe Treaties,</hi> (to wit: of <hi>Roſhilt</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen</hi>) as if thereby all what had been tranſacted and agreed upon in the Year 1675, at <hi>Renſburgh,</hi> was actually annull'd and made void, without any Exception; Whereas the <hi>Danes</hi> ſay, That theſe Words of this Article are plainly intended no further than of what had been concluded there <hi>in oppoſition to the Treaties of</hi> Roſhilt <hi>and</hi> Copenhagen. Now ſays they, it is manifeſt that theſe Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Rensburgh,</hi> which diveſt the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> of his Soveraignty, are abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſaid Treaties of <hi>Roſhilt</hi> and <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen;</hi> for which Reaſon alſo the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> has reſtor'd the Duke to his Soveraignty, and performed every thing elſe, that was done before, contrary to the ſaid Treaties; But as to what relates to the Impoſing and Collecting of Taxes, and the common Defence of the Dukedoms, thoſe Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Rensburgh,</hi> ſays they, as they are not oppoſite to the Treaties of <hi>Roſhilt</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> but have been introduced ſince contrary to the Union and antient Cuſtom obſerved betwixt thoſe two Houſes, ſo they have not been aboliſh'd by this Article of the Peace of <hi>Fountain-Bleau.</hi>

               <p>There being at that time ſome Differences on foot betwixt his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty and his Allies, by reaſon of the Concluſion of the late Peace
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56651:52"/>at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> being extreamly weakned by the vaſt Charges it had been at in proſecuting the War againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> this was look'd upon by the Duke and his Miniſters as a favourable Juncture for them, to puſh the point to the utmoſt, in order to obtain their End, which was ſuppoſed to be to diſſolve by degrees the whole Union betwixt thoſe two Houſes, the better to link themſelves with the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The Court of <hi>Denmark</hi> are very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in this Point, that they have authentick and undeniable Proofs, in their hands, by which it appears, that the Duke at that very time entred into new Alliances for that purpoſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing conſiderable Subſidies (ſuch as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Power to pay) to ſome Princes, not well affected to the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in caſe they would ſend ſome Forces into the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to back his Pretenſions. Whereupon the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> made a ſecond Sequeſtration of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> as far as it belong'd to the Duke's Juriſdiction, and at the ſame time made his Application to the Imperial Court, to deſire that ſome reaſonable Satisfaction might be given him, in reference to the Duke's Share in the Dukedom of <hi>Holſtein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things remained thus without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alteration till the Year 1689, when moſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> being engag'd in a War againſt <hi>France</hi> (the two Northern Crowns and <hi>Portugal</hi> excepted) the <hi>Swedes</hi> did lay hold of this Opportunity, to endeavour the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp.</hi> For which purpoſe they ſet out a good Fleet, as did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Danes</hi> to oppoſe them, in caſe they ſhould go about to ſecond their Threats by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56651:52"/>Blows; The Allies ſeeing that this was likely to kindle a War in the North, which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity bereave them of all the Hopes they had conceived of a powerful Succour from thence, againſt their common Enemy, uſed all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for a Reconciliation; to accompliſh which, the Emperour, and the two Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> offered their Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being accepted of on both ſides, a Treaty was ſet on foot at a place call'd <hi>Altena,</hi> under the Juriſdiction of his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty, as Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> not above an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Hamborough.</hi> Great application was likewiſe made to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as Guarantees of the Northern Peace; the laſt of which ſent Monſieur <hi>Heemſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerk,</hi> who in conjunction with the Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary from <hi>England,</hi> had a great hand in bringing the Matter to a Concluſion; But above all, the preſſing Inſtances of his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who was willing to take away from the <hi>Swedes</hi> all Pretenſions of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an Army over the <hi>Baltick;</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions of his Royal Highneſs Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> had ſo powerful an Influence upon the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Court, that on the 20th of <hi>June</hi> old Stile,<note place="margin">Peace made at <hi>Altena,</hi>
                  </note> a Peace was concluded betwixt the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> by vertue of which, the Duke was reſtored to all his Poſſeſſions and Rights (yet without the leaſt Reparations of Damages) upon the ſame foot, as he was poſſeſs'd of them by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Roſhilt</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen;</hi> tho' the <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi>'s Miniſters have ſince endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to a much larger Compaſs, of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more at large anon.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56651:53"/>
               <p>I will only ſay, that the Concluſion of this Treaty produced this good Effect for the Allies, that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Forces continued in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service, and, by vertue of a Treaty betwixt <hi>England</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the laſt ſent ſeven thouſand Souldiers to our Aſſiſtance, which did us conſiderable Service, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the very end of the War.</p>
               <p>And upon this occaſion I cannot paſs by in Silence the Generous Concurrence of His Royal Highneſs <hi>George</hi> Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in bringing the ſaid Treaty to a happy Iſſue. It is to be obſerved, that Purſuant to the laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. his youngeſt Son Prince <hi>George,</hi> was (beſides certain Allotments in Lands) to have the Summ of three hundred thouſand Crowns for his Share, which Summ, according to a Liquidation made betwixt his Brother King <hi>Christian</hi> V. and <hi>Christian Alben</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From whence ariſes the debt due to the Prince of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> was to be paid to the ſaid Prince, by the laſt; who for his better Security Mortgaged to him the Iſle of <hi>Fehmeren,</hi> beſides two or three other Ballia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, till the ſaid Summ ſhould be paid. Now, purſuant to the late Peace of <hi>Altena,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holstein Gottorp,</hi> being to be reſtored to all his Dominions, in the ſame manner as he was poſſeſs'd of them, by vertue of the Treaties of <hi>Roſhilt</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his unability to ſatisfy ſo conſiderable a Debt, after having been deprived of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Revenues, for near thirteen Years laſt paſt, His Royal Highneſs Prince <hi>George,</hi> not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Execution of the Peace, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all what in him lay towards the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56651:53"/>all occaſions of further Differences, did by an unparallel'd Act of Generoſity,<note place="margin">His Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.</note> freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the beforementioned Mortgaged Iſland and Balliages into the Duke's Hands, His Preſent Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> having Engaged their Word to ſatisfy the ſaid Debt to His Royal Highneſs; purſuant to which Agreement, His <hi>Britainick</hi> Majeſty recommended the ſaid Debt at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of this Seſſion of Parliament, to their Conſideration, with ſuch Succeſs, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Share of it is Aſſign'd to be paid out of the preſent Aid of two Shilling <hi>per</hi> Pound.</p>
               <p>So, that the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> owed this Obligation to his Brother-in-Law Prince <hi>George,</hi> to ſee himſelf once more reſtored to his Dominions, without the leaſt Incumbrance, the conſequence of which was, that the ſaid Duke ever after this laſt Reconciliation, lived in a perfect good underſtanding with King <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitan</hi> V. notwithſtanding ſome of his Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours endeavoured to ſow afreſh the Seeds of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betwixt them; but in vain, he continuing in the ſame Sentiment to the very laſt; of which good Correſpondence, one undeniable Inſtance was the Fortifications of <hi>Renſburgh</hi> and <hi>Tonnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> made by the Mutual Conſent of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the firſt by the King, the laſt by the Duke, looking upon thoſe places as the Bulwarks of the two Dukedoms for their Mutual Defence; But this good Harmony ceaſing with the ſaid Duke's Life, occaſioned thoſe Diviſions, which for theſe four or five Years paſt have been, and ſtill are on Foot, betwixt the Crown of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and the young Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore we purſue the thread of our Hiſtory concerning the Differences on Foot betwixt the two Houſes of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holstein Gottorp,</hi> we muſt look back as far as the Year 1686, when King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> V. Attack't the City of <hi>Hamborough</hi> with great Vigour. It is very well known that the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> lay Claim to that City as being Dukes of <hi>Holstein;</hi> to examine which, is beyond our preſent purpoſe, we will only give a brief Account of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which induced the ſaid King to take ſo Vigorous a Reſolution,<note place="margin">Differences betwixt the Senate and Commonalty of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> occaſion this Siege.</note> to back his Pretenſions. It is therefore to be obſerved, that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Differences ariſen between the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and the Commonalty of that City ſome years before, the ſame were carried on by the <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> to ſuch a hight, that the Commonweal was threatned with an Imminent Ruine, by reaſon of their refuſing to pay any Taxes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of the Government, before their Grievances were Redreſs'd, which tended Chiefly to make new Encroachments upon the Authority of the Senate.</p>
               <p>To prevent the further ill Conſequence of this popular Miſchief, it was thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56651:54"/>to ſeek for Redreſs by His Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who thereupon ſent the Count of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Graetz,</hi> as his Commiſſioner, to endeavour the Compoſition of thoſe Differences, which he effected accordingly, by putting a check upon the Ring-leaders of the diſſatisfied Party, and confirming the Senate in his Authority.</p>
               <p>There was about that time in the Senate, one Mr. <hi>Nicholas Crull,</hi> a Man of a very active Spirit, who having been formerly a great Patron of the Commonalty in maintaining their Liberties, as long as they contained themſelves within their due Bounds, did afterwards, when they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed their Limits, prove as ſtrenuous an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of the Senate's Authority, of which he was a Member, and was very inſtrumental in reducing ſome of the Leading Men of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party to their Duty. Thoſe not being able to digeſt thoſe hard Terms they were under (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Opinion) laid hold of the firſt Opportunity, after the departure of the Imperial Commiſſioner, to repreſent at one of the publick Aſſemblies of the Commonalty, this Senator as a Perſon, who had endangered the publick Liberty, and therefore not to be ſuffered to continue in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he might have frequent opportunity to clip their Wings; The Bait of <hi>Publick Liberty</hi> was ſo greedily ſwallowed by the unthinking Multitude, that they were all for removing the ſaid Mr. <hi>Crull</hi> from his Station in the Senate, and with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence demanded it; ſo that the Senate not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to withſtand, after many Conteſts, their fury, ſaw themſelves under a neceſſity to Conſent, to have the ſaid Mr. <hi>Crull,</hi> ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the preſent, of his Function.

               <p>The Proceedings of the Commonalty being againſt all form of Law, he ſoon obtained a Mandat from the Emperour for his Reſtauration, which being as little regarded by the Commons of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> as the former had been, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſent his Orders to the ſaid Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> as Director of the Circle of Lower <hi>Saxony.</hi> Mr. <hi>Meuring</hi> being a Man of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Eſtate,<note place="margin">He engages the Duke of <hi>Zell</hi> in the Quarrel.</note> ſoon engag'd the Court of <hi>Zell</hi> in his Intereſt, ſo that they not only ſtop't the Paſſage of all the <hi>Veſſels</hi> that came down the River towards <hi>Hamborough,</hi> but at laſt ſent ſome of their Troops into their Territories, where they were to live upon free Coſt, till ſuch time the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> ſhould comply with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Mandats.</p>

               <p>It was the wonder of all <hi>Europe</hi> at that time, to ſee the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> Attack a City with fifteen or ſixteen thouſand Men, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vaſt extent of its Fortifications and Strength (being five or ſix Miles in Compaſs) required rather an Army of three or four ſcore thouſand Men to beſiege it in due form. It was the general Opinion at that time, that the ſaid Attack would ſcarce have been undertaken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſecret Correſpondence within the Place, and the diſſatisfied Party of that City was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, who ſeeing their Affairs reduced to a deſperate Condition, were ſuppoſed to have no

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56651:58"/>two Houſes; but the Duke having tranſgreſſed theſe Bounds by taking Foreigners into his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and making new Levies without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he had ordered his Miniſters to deſire him, firſt, to let him know, what Share, by vertue of the deceaſed Duke <hi>Chriſtian Albert</hi>'s Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his younger Brother <hi>Chriſtian</hi> had in the two Dukedoms?

               <p>This Letter together with the Dukes Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution upon the two other Points, were ſo ill reliſhing to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Court, that they gave

Beſides, That the Territories allotted to each of thoſe Houſes are ſo intermixt by their Situation, that it is impoſſible for the Troops of one of thoſe Princes, to March thro' any conſiderable part of the Country, without paſſing thro' the other; by which it appears that the Anceſtors of thoſe two Houſes intended to prevent all pretences of making ſeparate Levies, without a mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both Parties; ſo, ſays they, That the Duke has no more Power to receive any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Troops in the Dukedoms, without the Approbation of HIs Majeſty, than a private Perſon has to permit Strangers to take Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Houſe, which he has in co-partnerſhip with others.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56651:61"/>

               <p>This Practice has been conſtantly obſerved till the Year 1657, before which time, no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preparations were ever undertaken without Joynt-Conſent, the ſummoning of the Militia of the Country, as well as the Levies of regular Troops being always undertaken, after mutual
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56651:62"/>deliberations in both Sides Names, every one bearing his Share in the Charges, the Officers as well as Soldiers being obliged to take an Oath to the Government in general. The Marches and Enquarterings of the Soldiery, the building of the neceſſary Forts, and their Defence, the Garriſoning of Places, the Disbanding or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of their Troops, buying up of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Artillery and other Neceſſaries, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions of further Levies, permitted to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nay, even the entring into foreign Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, or whatever elſe had any relation to the common defence of thoſe Countries, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly tranſacted with joint Council, and in the Name of both Houſes.

               <p>In a Letter written the 10th of <hi>May</hi> in the Year 1554. the then Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp Adolph</hi> excuſes himſelf to the King of <hi>Denmark; That he, for weighty Reaſons, had found himſelf under a neceſſity to make Levies of ſome Horſe and Foot, in the King's Abſence, not queſtioning but his Majeſty would approve his Conduct.</hi> And when in the Year 1559. <hi>Frederick</hi> II. the then King of <hi>Denmark</hi> conceived a Jealouſy at ſome Levies he had made, he ſent ſome of his Miniſters to the ſaid Duke, to be truly inform'd of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who excuſed himſelf, that being then Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of the Circle of the <hi>Lower Sxony</hi> (which he had not accepted of but with the King's good liking) he had made thoſe Levies in behalf of the Circle and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> notwithſtanding which, at an Interview betwixt the King and the Duke at <hi>Nortorf,</hi> it was agreed, that thoſe Forces, as well Officers as Soldiers, ſhould be taken into their Joint-Pay, and ſwear Fealty to them accordingly.</p>

               <p>That tho' he had taken Care to Summon the Nobility and other Inhabitants, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to oppoſe any Invaders;<note place="margin">Another Letter of that Duke's upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> and that, tho' HIs Majeſty had ſent his Orders to <hi>Berent Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> to haſten the Complement of his Company, and that with all poſſible ſpeed; he had already <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to His Majeſty</hi> the Reſolution he had taken of Levying a Troop of Horſe; nevertheleſs, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that a good Body of Foot would be more ſerviceable to them in Caſe of an Invaſion, he was reſolved to order <hi>(yet not without His Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,)</hi> another Company of Foot to be Levied at the Charge of the Country, under the Command of <hi>John Scheſtede;</hi> and that he had ſent the Commiſſion for His Majeſty, if he pleaſed to Sign it.</p>
               <p>The King ſent his anſwer to the ſaid Duke, dated 13 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1623. telling him that he had Conſented to thoſe Levies, and had Sign'd the Commiſſion accordingly.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1634, the 4th of <hi>May,</hi> an Alliance was concluded betwixt thoſe two Princes, one Article of which was: That, <hi>according to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56651:66"/>Cuſtom,</hi> no Levies ſhould be made without their Joint-Conſent.</p>
               <p>The ſame being renewed in the Year 1636, it was propoſed to the Eſtates, Aſſembled at <hi>Kiel,</hi> both in the King and Duke's Name, to raiſe 2000 Men.</p>
               <p>Thus King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. and the ſaid Duke propoſed with joint-Conſent to the Eſtates, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Kiel,</hi> in the Year 1653, that it would be Neceſſary to make ſome Levies, beſides what they had on foot already; the ſame was done at the Aſſembly of the Eſtates in the ſame place, in the Year 1655. And in the Year 1656, the Eſtates Aſſembled at <hi>Renſburgh,</hi> having Conſented to ſome new Levies, the ſame were made, both in the King and Duke's Name.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Year 1657, juſt before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that War between <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> which had almoſt proved Fatal to the firſt, it was propos'd to the Eſtates, then Aſſembled at <hi>Flenſburgh,</hi> both in the King and Duke's Name, that it would be very requiſite to increaſe their Forces, and to make, (beſides the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Troops, that were already upon the Frontiers of the two Dukedoms) ſome new Levies, which was done accordingly, both in the King and Duke's Name.</p>
               <p>But there being one moſt remarkable inſtance of the acknowledgment of Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Point in queſtion, it ought not to be left paſt by in ſilence here.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that in the Year 1633. <hi>Charles</hi> I. King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſent Mr. <hi>Robert Anſtruth,</hi> as his Envoy to the ſaid Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein Gottorp,</hi> to repreſent to him the dangerous Condition the Proteſtants were reduced to at that time, and to concert Matters with him, how to reprieve them from that Danger, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56651:67"/>threatned their Total Deſtruction, unleſs by giving a Powerful Aſſiſtance to them; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhes were forced to grant them an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peace, Some means were alſo propoſed, to endeavour the Reſtitution of the Elector <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batin;</hi> upon which the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi> ordered the following Letter to be ſent to King <hi>Charles</hi> I.</p>

               <p>We thought our ſelves obliged to acquaint Your Majeſty, that His <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty did lately ſend to Us his Envoy Mr. <hi>Robert Anſtruth,</hi> who purſuant to his Orders received from the King his Maſter, has made ſeveral Propoſitions to Us both by way of Mouth and in Writing,

We have all the reaſon in the World to believe, that the ſaid Envoy will in a little time urge our Miniſters, for a poſitive Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being ſenſible that <hi>the Matter is of ſuch a weight as concerns our mutual Intereſt.</hi> We thought fit, to propoſe it to Your Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether it might not be Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to order our both ſides Miniſters, who are to meet and to reviſe ſome Statutes relating to our Provincial Courts of Judicature, immediately after the Fair of <hi>Kiel,</hi> to <hi>enter into Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences upon the ſaid Point, and to give <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon it, in order to be ratified by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>

               <p>The Miniſters of the Duke of <hi>Holstein Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi>'s Reply to this, That the Anſwer ſent to K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. being to be look't upon no otherwiſe than a Compliment, ought not to be alledged in their prejudice; but the Letter ſent to King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> V. upon that Account, and the enſuing Conferences ſeem to put it beyond all doubt.</p>
               <p>We will now proceed to the fourth Argument alledged by the <hi>Danes</hi> upon this Head, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is contrary to the Antient Unions.</p>

               <p>As to what relates to Us, we being ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced by the expreſs Letter of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">A Letter written by Duke <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> to King <hi>Chriſtian IV</hi> upon this Head.</note> That <hi>not only the Contrahentes and Paciſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but likewiſe their Poſterity is obliged to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them,</hi> we are not only reſolved to adhere to them (with the help of God) invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably as long as we live, but likewiſe <hi>our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours are oblig'd to do the ſame.</hi> Neither do We in the leaſt queſtion, but Your Majeſty will make a ſuitable Return, in concurring with Us in the ſame, as often as occaſion ſhall require, in hopes that <hi>the due obſervance of thoſe fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, made for the joint Intereſt and Welfare of theſe Dukedoms, will for the future, as it has done heretofore, tend to our mutual Benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident both out of the preceding, and ſeveral others of the beforementioned Letters, how often the Dukes have had recourſe to the words of thoſe Unions, when they thought themſelves injured in any thing that related to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56651:68"/>the common Defence of thoſe Countries; and there are not wanting Inſtances, when they have received actual Relief from the Kings of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> as Dukes of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> not only in Caſe of an Invaſion, but alſo upon the Account of other Dangers; of which there was a notable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Year 1623. When the Marſh Lands belonging to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overflown with Water, the Duke claim'd Aſſiſtance from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> as Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and that he ſhould bear his Share in the Loſs and repairing the Damages ſuſtain'd, by vertue of the Antient Unions. And how is it poſſible, ſay the <hi>Danes,</hi> that ſince, according to the Confeſſion of the Miniſters of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> theſe two Dukedoms, notwithſtanding the diviſion betwixt thoſe two Houſes, remain one inſeparable Body, they ſhould not be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a mutual concurrence in their common defence.</p>
               <p>That thoſe Unions are made betwixt the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> as the firſt are Dukes, is confirmed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of that Court, call d the Court of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtregen,</hi> in which, not only ſuch Differences as have happened betwixt the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> as the firſt were Kings, but alſo, as they were Dukes, have been decided.</p>
               <p>Thus a difference being ariſen in the Year 1559, betwixt thoſe two Houſes, concerning ſome Marſhlands, ſituate betwixt <hi>Tundern</hi> and <hi>Flenſburgh;</hi> and in the Year 1565, concerning the Limits between the two Dukes, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Adolph,</hi> the ſame werre determined by this Court.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:56651:69"/>
               <p>In the Year 1580,<note place="margin">The Court for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the two Houſes.</note> there happened a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Difference betwixt <hi>Frederick</hi> II.

               <p>Thus, in the Year 1632, when King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> IV. had begun to erect a Fort, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Chriſtianſprice,</hi> without the Conſent of <hi>Frederick,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> he thinking himſelf aggriev'd in this Point, made his Appeal to the ſaid Court, conſtituted by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the antient Unions,<note place="margin">Duke <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon that ſubject.</note> as appears by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, written to the ſaid King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> IV. dated at <hi>Gottorp</hi> the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> 1632.</p>
               <p>I hope Your Majeſty will not refuſe to deſiſt from the ſaid Fortification, till the Arguments and Rights of both ſides may be examined and compoſed, according to the true Meaning of the antient, <hi>and ſince renewed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> betwixt the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi> and our Anceſtors; or by our both ſides Miniſters deputed for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; or, if that ſhould not ſucceed, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive

               <p>It will not be beyond our purpoſe to inſert here the Chief heads of the Tranſactions which happened betwixt the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the late Duke of <hi>Holstein Gottorp, Chriſtian Albert,</hi> in a Caſe, concerning the diviſion of ſome Limits near <hi>Liſt</hi> and <hi>Silt,</hi> the Rights of ſome Oyſter-Pits, and other Matters of no ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; foraſmuch as they ſhew the manner of of Proceeding in this Court, by the ſaid Duke's own Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>They deputed an equal Number of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this Court.</note> who being releaſed from their Oath of Fidelity, had full Power granted them by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Patent, dated the 5th of <hi>November,</hi> 1667, to examine, debate, and decide the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Queſtion, and, in caſe of a Parity of Votes, to appoint an Umpire for the deciſion of the Matter.</p>
               <p>Purſuant to which the Conferences were opened in the Year 1668, in the City of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,</hi> by reaſon of the nearneſs of that Place, to thoſe in queſtion, (the City of <hi>Coldingen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe appointed by the Antient Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, for this Court to Sit in) where the Differences being carefully examined the refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the determination of thoſe Deputies, their Votes were found equal, ſo, that with mutual Conſent it was agreed to leave the final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it to an Umpire. In reference of which the late Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Albert,</hi> writ the following Letter to <hi>Frederick</hi> III.

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56651:70"/>
               <p>Your Majeſty has been doubtleſs informed how the Matter under debate of our both ſides Commiſſioners at <hi>Tundern,</hi>

It is evident from our Records, that in ſuch Caſes as this, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Princes have been Choſen for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Differences ariſen between theſe two Houſes, they uſed always, after they had taken a full Information of the whole Matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to depute three of their Miniſers, fitly qualified for ſo Great a Truſt, who, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, were to give their definitive Sentence, by the Majority of Votes. This has been very <hi>wiſely inſtituted by our Anceſtors, who were the Authors of the Antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions;</hi> and did not think it reaſonable that both Your Majeſty's and our Rights ſhould depend on the Judgment only of a ſingle Perſon, but that a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Delegates ſhould be appointed by the Umpire, inſtructed with a ſufficient Authority, to examin the Merits of the Cauſe on both ſides, and after a mature deliberation, to proceed to Judgment, without any Reſpect to Perſons. Thus in the Year 1576, the then Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> being agreed upon for an Umpire, he deputed <hi>Volekmar Van Bentiſh,</hi> the then Judge of the High Court of Judicature at <hi>Leipzick; John Van Seidlitz,</hi> Governour of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and <hi>Veit Winſheimb,</hi> a Profeſſor of the Law in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> who in the ſame Year, by the Majority of Votes, decided the Differences in Hand. Being therefore fully convinced that no private Perſon can be a Competent Judge of thoſe Differences but that they ought to be ſubmitted to the deciſion of ſuch Delegates as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56651:70"/>are impowred with a ſufficient Authority by the Umpire, We have thought fit to propoſe to Your Majeſty on our ſide the Adminiſtrator of <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> or Duke <hi>Ernest</hi> of <hi>Weymar Gotha,</hi> leaving it to Your Majeſty to propoſe on Your ſide, whom you ſhall Judge moſt Convenient.</p>
               <p>But becauſe both Parties Inſiſted upon their propoſal, the Matter did remain undecided for that time.</p>
               <p>There are three other Letters written by the ſame Duke upon the Account of this Court of <hi>Austregen,</hi> to King <hi>Frederick</hi> III.<note place="margin">Another Letter from that Duke upon the ſame ſubject.</note> of which we will give you the Contents as far as they have any relation to this Head.</p>
               <p>The firſt is dated at <hi>Gottorp</hi> the 14th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1665.</p>
               <p>It could not but be highly acceptable to us, when we underſtood that Your Majeſty had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put an end to thoſe Differences, which have been depending for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, betwixt thoſe two Houſes, and for that purpoſe had appointed ſix <hi>Aſſeſſors</hi> on Your ſide, purſuant to the <hi>Conſtitution of the inſeparable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions of both Houſes;</hi> and, We ſincerely declare to Your Majeſty, that We aim at nothing more, than that an end may be put thoſe differences, to our both ſides Satisfaction; <hi>Our Intention being to inſiſt upon nothing, but what can plainly be proved to belong to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but, that Your Majeſty's Intention in this, as well as in all other Actions of Your Life, will be conformable to what Juſtice and Reaſon ſhall allow of.

               <p>To this the <hi>Danes</hi> Reply, that the Chief thing then in queſtion being the Inveſtiture and Vaſſalage of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> the ſame did not fall under the Cogniſance of this <hi>Court of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi> the ſame being expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the <hi>

                     </hi> Reply.</note> how the Miniſters of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> ſhould look upon this Reſtriction as a Paradox; What, ſay they, can a Prince not be a Soveraign, that is engag'd in, and limited by certain Contracts made with another Prince? Who can queſtion the Soveragnty of each particular Province of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands?</hi> Nevertheleſs by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Union and fundamental Contracts, they are obliged to make no Alliances, Peace or War, without Joint-Advice and Conſent. It is taken for granted, that neither the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour nor the <hi>French</hi> King think themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in their Soveraignties, becauſe by the Treaties of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Reſwick</hi> (as eſpecially appears from the 18, 20, and 25 of the laſt) they are limited in their Prerogatives of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying places; Beſides, that there are ſeveral Inſtances of Family Contracts amongſt the Princes of the Empire, who think themſelves not a Jot the worſe upon that account. At that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56651:73"/>rate they muſt call in queſtion the Soveraignty of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> himſelf, becauſe in the ſeveral Treaties, but eſpecially in that of the year 1664, made with His Imperial Majeſty, he has for ever renounced his Right of fortifying <hi>Zeckemheyet,</hi> and the Fort near <hi>Caniſha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Argument made uſe of by the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi>'s Party, is, that it cannot but be look'd upon as an unreaſonable thing, for any Body to be debarr'd of the Priviledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and managing his own Inheritance as he thinks moſt convenient, which in effect, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> pretends to do.</p>
               <p>This Argument, reply the <hi>Danes,</hi> anſwers it ſelf, it being evident that the King and Duke are Joint-Lords of thoſe Dukedoms; and the Nature of all things in joint-Poſſeſſion being ſuch, as not to admit of being diſpoſed of at the Pleaſure of one of the Parties; Beſides, that it is a Miſtake that a Man may act in his own Inheritance as he pleaſes, it being evident that he ought to take care not to annoy his Neighbours; and the moſt Potent and Soveraign Princes themſelves are always very cautious in giving offence, nay even in creating a Jealouſy in their neighbouring Nations.</p>
               <p>It is beyond all Contradiction that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Roſhilt</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> from whence the Duke derives his Soveraignty, have not granted the ſame to him without Reſtriction, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Patent granted to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> upon the account of this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, by King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. in the year 1658, in which are theſe following Conditions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Nobility, Eſtates and Cities, nay all the Subjects ſhall be inviolably maintain'd in

                  </note> as likewiſe in their Rights, Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That neither any conſiderable part, or the whole Share of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> ſhall be abalienated to the Prejudice of the Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but ſhall remain in the ſame State it is now, as long as there are any Male Heirs living of Duke <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>But the main Streſs of the Argument made uſe of by the Duke's Miniſters to back their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Jus Armorum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the ſecond Article of the Treaty of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Character of King <hi>Chriſtian V.</hi> his Court; with ſome other Matters relating to his Perſon, and the Royal Family.</head>
               <p>THE good Qualities of this Prince were ſuch as deſerve to be rank'd amongſt the beſt our Age has produced; As the preceding Sheets do ſufficiently convince us, that his whole Genius was bent upon Action, ſo even his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies cannot deny, but that in the execution of his Deſigns,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> he ſhew'd as much Perſonal Courage as could have been expected from a private Man. Of this he gave frequent demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations in his Wars with <hi>Sweden,</hi> when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appeared at the Head of his Army's, and by his own Example animated them to doing well: In the Attack made upon the City <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> he expoſed his Perſon ſo near to the Enemies Shot, that ſeveral Perſons of Note, who attended him, were ſlain by his ſide. There are few, I believe, who can deny, that his Conduct in that War, was anſwerable to his Courage,<note place="margin">His Conduct.</note> the whole deſign againſt a too Potent neighbouring Enemy, being founded upon the deepeſt Reaſons of State, the fruits of which <hi>Denmark</hi> might have reap'd to its great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> by clapping up a ſeparate Peace with <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> had not fruſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Deſigns of their King.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56651:82"/>
               <p>He was a Prince of ſingular Aſſability and good Nature,<note place="margin">His Aſſability.</note> Mild and Gracious, without the leaſt appearance of Pride, being both Beloved and Reverenc'd by his People, who, unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree in this, that during the whole Courſe of his Reign, he never abuſed his Abſolute Power; and ſuch was his Affability, that even when he dined in Publick, he would ſit down not only with his Queen, Children and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but alſo with his Miniſters and General Officers.</p>
               <p>The moſt refined Politicians in theſe Parts, give him this Character,<note place="margin">Religion.</note> That he had as much Religion as was becoming a Prince, being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious without being bigotted to his Clergy, whom, tho' he allowed to ſpeak with all due Freedom in the Pulpits, and to correct the Vices of Perſons, even of the firſt Quality, yet never admitted them into the Secrets of the Government. Of his Moderation in Point of Religion he has given ſeveral Inſtances, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants to build a Church at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to erect a Chappel at <hi>Gluckstadt,</hi> things never known in <hi>Denmark</hi> ſince the Reformation; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in the Northern Parts not allowing the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exerciſe of any, but their own Religion.</p>
               <p>He was Maſter of four Languages, to wit: The <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own; and tho' neither by his Genius he was inclining, nor by his Education had ever been improved in any particular Sort of Learning, yet as his War-like Temper made him love Fortifications, ſo he was as great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Geographical Delineations, and would with a great deal of Delight examine the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56651:82"/>of any Forts, to be erected in convenient Places.</p>
               <p>He was not in the leaſt Luxurious in his Meat and Drink;<note place="margin">His Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> and if in his younger days he would now and then commit an Exceſs in the laſt, this was recompenſed by his Moderation of late Years.</p>
               <p>The ſame might be obſerved in all his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, which were either certain Progreſſes, which he uſed frequently to make into <hi>Sleſwick, Holſtein,</hi> or ſome of the adjucent Iſlands, or elſe Divertiſements at his Country Seats: Every Summer he uſed to ſpend five or ſix Weeks at his Hunting-Houſe of <hi>Jagerſburgh,</hi>

               <p>At a certain Seaſon, when the young Swans are grown up almoſt to the bigneſs of the old ones, Swan-hunting uſed to be his Paſtime, which was performed by a good number of <hi>Gondola</hi>'s or Small Boats, fill'd with Gentlemen and Ladies, who ſurrounding the Iſland in which the Swans abide, they uſed ſometimes to kill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſands of them with their Guns.</p>

               <p>But before we conclude this Chapter, we muſt alſo ſpeak ſomething concerning the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>We have told you before,<note place="margin">The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Queen.</note> that he Married the Lady <hi>Charlotta Amalia,</hi> Siſter to the preſent <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe Caſſel;</hi> She is a moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon, in Reſpect of Her Great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, both of body and Mind; She is Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably Fair, and Extraordinary well Shap'd, Her Complexion being a perfect mixture of Flegmatick and Sanguin; But the Excellencies of Her Mind far ſurpaſs thoſe of Her Body, being Engaging, Aſſable, and free to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree; She has given a thouſand Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Her Prudent Conduct; eſpecially in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants; and others who had thrown themſelves under Her Protection; She being always look'd upon by the whole Kingdom, as the common Refuge of People in Diſtreſs.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56651:84"/>
               <p>The King had five Children by Her; to wit: Four Princes and one Princeſs; The Eldeſt was <hi>Frederick,</hi> who ſome Months ago has ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Throne, being now about ſeven or eight and twenty Years of Age.</p>
               <p>The Second was Prince <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Children.</note> of a very robuſt Conſtitution, and much addicted to Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and War-like Exerciſes; he died ſome years ago in his Travels, at <hi>Augsburgh</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third was called <hi>Charles,</hi> being now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixteen; and the Fourth, <hi>William,</hi> about thirteen years of Age.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs his only Daughter is look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the greateſt Beauty of the North; ſhe was Contracted to the Electoral Prince of <hi>Saxony,</hi> but the Match was broke off.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, it is evident, that the late King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> V. was a Prince endow'd with all the Qualifications belonging to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo Eminent a Rank; For whereas he found the Kingdom in a very declining Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of the late unfortunate War with <hi>Sweden;</hi> He reſtored, in ſome meaſure, its decayed Eſtate, by providing for the Security of its Frontiers: The Citadel in the Iſle of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> commanding the Road of <hi>Roena,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Dominions,<note place="margin">The late Kings Core for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Kingdom.</note> was brought to Perfection by his Care, in the Year 1689, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortified after the Modern Manner with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Outworks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cronenburgh,</hi> Famous for its Situation on the Paſſage of the <hi>Sound,</hi> ows its perfection alſo to this King, its Fortifications being now all faced with Brick:</p>
               <p>So the City of <hi>Renſburgh</hi> ſtands indebted to this King for the enlargement of its Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56651:85"/>This place being ſituate upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders betwixt <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein,</hi> on the River <hi>Eyder,</hi> was by his Orders made a Royal Fortification, the Bulwarks and Outworks being all faced with Brick, which could not be done without a prodigious Charge,</p>
               <p>It is acknowledg'd on all hands, that whereas at the time of his Acceſſion to the Throne, the Forces of that Kingdom were neither numerous nor well diſciplin'd;<note place="margin">His Army.</note> he introduced ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation among them, that he left near 40000 Men, as good Troops as any are in <hi>Europe,</hi> who have ſignalized themſelves in ſeveral Parts againſt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Ottomans.</hi> His Maritim Affairs left in ſo good a Condition, that 'tis believ'd the preſent young King will bring a Fleet of 40 Men of War in the <hi>Baltick</hi> next Summer; and as to what concerns his Revenues,<note place="margin">His Revenue.</note> we have told before, that what with the good Management of the Treaſury, and the vaſt Improvement of Trade in that Kingdom, whilſt we were engag'd in a War with <hi>France,</hi> they have been improv'd beyond what could have been rationally expected, conſidering the vaſt Charges he was forc'd to be at in maintaining ſo Conſiderable an Army.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Account, we will add, that as he was naturally of a very robuſt Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſo he was always forward in undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of Fatigue, which at laſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſome Fits of the Gout, and theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing by degrees, threw him into a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment, of which he died on the 22th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1699, leaving the Throne to his Eldeſt Son, now King <hi>Frederick</hi> IV.</p>

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>JUſt as I was upon Concluding this Treatiſe, the following Propoſitions, made by the two contending Parties, to the Miniſters Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, Aſſembled at <hi>Pinnenbergh,</hi> came to my Hands, which, as they may ſerve towards the Clucidation of what has been ſaid upon the ſeveral Heads now in Conteſt betwixt them, ſo, I thought it abſolutely Requiſite to afford them a Place here.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty's of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> &amp;c. Propoſitions made to the Miniſters Mediators, on the 24th of <hi>Auguſt, O. S.</hi> 1696, at <hi>Pinnenbergh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) That the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> and <hi>Hereditary Contracts,</hi> as likewiſe the <hi>Communion</hi> founded upon the former, may be explain'd, and put into a due Light, Purſuant to their true Intent and Meaning.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That, what concerns the diſpute about the <hi>Jus Armorum,</hi> ſuch as Creating of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and making of Levies, with all other Matters relating to the Common Defence of theſe Dukedoms; it may continue in the ſame manner as has been practiſed before, according to Antient Cuſtom; and what ever has been done in this point on the Duke's ſide, contrary to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions, Family-Contracts,</hi> and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> ſhall for the future, be redreſs'd and and quite Aboliſh'd.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:56651:86"/>
               <p n="3">(3) That the Joint-Defence of thoſe Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhall be reſettled upon the antient Foot, and to prevent all further Jealouſie upon that Account for the future, the Taxes Levied as well upon the Prelates and Nobility as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all the Subjects in General to be brought into one Joint-Treaſury, as it was before the Agreement made in the Year 1663, betwixt both Houſes, which (being done with mutual Conſent, and only for a certain time, ought to be quite annull'd for the future.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> deſires, that the laſt Will and Teſtament of the late Duke <hi>Christian Albert</hi> may be Communicated to him.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) All remaining Grievances to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within a limited time, by an Amicable Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and in Caſe ſome Differences remain, the ſame to be decided according to the true intent of the <hi>Compacts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Propoſitions made by order from His Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> upon the Propoſitions delivered by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the 24th of <hi>August</hi> 1696, to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Mediators, at <hi>Pinnenbergh,</hi> the 14th of <hi>September</hi> O. S. 1606.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) His Highneſs is willing to renew the ſo much deſired <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> but upon no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than was ſtipulated in the Trcaties of <hi>Gluckſtadt</hi> and <hi>Altena;</hi> provided alſo, that his other Grievances may be Redreſs'd, and the King renew the ſame on his ſide. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the joint Dominion over the Nobility and Prelates (for the ſame ought not to be extended over the reſt) mentioned and introduced in the Her editary Diviſions and Family-Contracts, the ſome ought to be look'd upon no otherwiſe than
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56651:86"/>Family-Agreements, but not as fundamental and unalterable Laws, never to be diſſolved or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd; The contrary of which appears from what has been declared in the <hi>Northern</hi> Treaties, that of <hi>Gluckstadt;</hi> and by His Majeſty's own Conceſſion, wherewith His Highneſs is willing to reſt ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In caſe there ſhould be an imminent Occaſion of an extraordinary Proviſion to be made for the defence of theſe Dukedoms; His Majeſty and His Highneſs as Joint Lords there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will, according to antient Cuſtom, enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſultations and agree upon this Point; But as to what concerns the Rights or entring into Alliances, to erect Fortifications and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Levies, this is put beyond all diſpute by the Treaty of <hi>Altena,</hi> which grants to His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, among other Regal Rights, thoſe before-mentioned without any Reſtriction, Limitation, or previous Communication; in which ſenſe it was not only taken and ſigned by the Mediators, but alſo by the Princes, who were Guarantees of the ſaid Treatyl; His Highneſs is not in the leaſt ſenſible, that on his part there has been done any thing againſt that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which is ſo earneſtly deſired to be renewed, no more than againſt the Hereditary Diviſion and Communion; His Highneſs being willing to be only ſecured in the quiet poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) His Highneſs has made it his utmoſt Care to provide for the defence of the Country, for which purpoſe he has taken ſome foreign Troops into his Service, and has made conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Levies, and put his Fortifications in a poſture of defence, having expended upon this Account not only what Taxes have been levied,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56651:87"/>but alſo conſiderable Summs ariſing from his own Demeaſnes; But what is alledg'd concerning the aboliſhing of a Treaty made in the Year 1663, and that it would tend to the removing of all farther Jealouſies and Miſunderſtandings, if the Taxes raiſed, as well from the Balliages, Lands and Cities, as the Nobility and Prelates were brought into one common Treaſury; His Highneſs is of quite another Sentiment; He looks upon it as a thing depending meerly on the pleaſure of Soveraigns, which way Taxes are to be raiſed, to wit: from their own Subjects, ſo that neither party receives any prejudice by it. The due obſervance of the Treaties of the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Gluckstadt,</hi> and of what ſince has been declared by His Majeſty, would prove a more effectual means to prevent all farther Jealouſy and differences.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) What concerns the Communication of the Laſt Will and Teſtament of His Highneſſes Father the late Duke <hi>Chriſtian Albert,</hi> His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perſwades himſelf, that the Reaſons alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to His Majeſty, and ſince publiſhed, will be ſo prevailing, as to induce him not to inſiſt any farther upon this point.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) After His Highneſs has been redreſs'd concerning the beforementioned Grievances and Propoſitions, by the Interceſſion of the Princes Mediators, he is willing that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Differences may be referr'd to an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Compoſition; and in caſe that ſhould take no effect by a legal Procedure, purſuant to the Intent of the Treaty of <hi>Altena,</hi> which does not mention the leaſt of the Deciſion of ſuch Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as may ariſe betwixt both Houſes, as they are Dukes of thoſe Dukedoms, to be done
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56651:87"/>by the Judgment of the Court of Unions.</p>
               <p>Many more Obſervations might be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Propoſitions, but as moſt of them have a near relation to what has been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo we will only alledge here in a few words, what the <hi>Danes</hi> reply to the Allegation of the Treaty of <hi>Gluckstadt,</hi> ſo often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Duke's Propoſitions:</p>
               <p>They ſay that this Treaty (containing the Preliminaries of the Marriage-Contract betwixt the Daughter of King <hi>Frederick</hi> III. and the late Duke) ſeveral Tranſgreſſions made on that Duke's ſide, were thereby buried in eternal Oblivion, without inſiſting upon every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which ought not to be drawn into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Prejudice of His <hi>Daniſh</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; it being eſpecially provided for in the ſaid Treaty, that all the <hi>Antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their full force and vigour.</p>
